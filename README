This I2C menu demo written in the Arduino programming language for an Arduino Uno controller.  It runs on a special version of the ELK204-7T-1U enclosure, but the functions can be adapted to any Matrix Orbital display.

It is built upon the Wire.h library, but contains a number of higher level functions to create menus, process user input, and provide live screen updates.

Please visit https://www.matrixorbital.ca for more information including manuals for all Matrix Orbital displays.

I am a part of the design and support teams at Matrix Orbital, but this is a project undertaken in my own time in an effort to understand how our displays preform in the Arduino environment.

Thanks,
Troy
